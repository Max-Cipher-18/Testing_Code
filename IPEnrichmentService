Certainly, I can provide a more production-ready version of the code with improved error handling and additional comments:

import java.net.InetAddress;
import java.net.UnknownHostException;

public class IPEnrichmentService {

    public static String convertHostnameToIPAddress(String hostname) {
        try {
            InetAddress inetAddress = InetAddress.getByName(hostname);
            return inetAddress.getHostAddress();
        } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
            // Log the error and return an error message or throw a custom exception
            System.err.println("Error resolving IP address for hostname: " + hostname);
            e.printStackTrace();
            return null; // You can customize this to return an error code or message
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String hostname = "example.com"; // Replace with the hostname you want to convert

        String ipAddress = convertHostnameToIPAddress(hostname);

        if (ipAddress != null) {
            System.out.println("Hostname: " + hostname);
            System.out.println("IP Address: " + ipAddress);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Unable to resolve the IP address for the hostname: " + hostname);
        }
    }
}

In this updated version:

We've added a more informative error message when an exception is caught in the convertHostnameToIPAddress method.
We've included comments for clarity and documentation.
The code now prints an error message to the standard error stream (System.err) when a hostname cannot be resolved, providing better visibility into the issue.
You can customize the return null; line to return an error code or message that suits your application's needs.
This code should be more suitable for production use, but please consider further enhancing it depending on your specific requirements, such as handling exceptions gracefully, logging errors to a file, or implementing retry mechanisms if needed.
